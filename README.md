# CODCAMO
This project is a better way to view what camos you have unlocked
## How it works
It works like a spreadsheet, you mark what camo you unlocked and follows the same unlocking rules as the game.
### Saving
The data is storage locally on your web browser 
## How to clone the project
* Git clone to your folder 
* Use npm install to install the dependencies
* If you have a node version that is not supported by Angular, install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to manage your node version
